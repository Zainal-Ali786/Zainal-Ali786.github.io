## Setting Up a Virtual Home Lab running Active Directory (using Oracle VirtualBox)
In this lab we will set up a virtual home lab consisting of a domain controller, DHCP server, File Server and 2 clients.

### Download and Install Oracle VirtualBox

### Create Virtual Machines(VM)
Here I created the domain controller, DHCP server, File Server, and the two clients. The clients are running Windows 10, the Servers are running Windows Server 2016

### I realized that I was overly ambitious on my PC's capabilities and decided on running just the Domain Controller, DHCP Server and one client PC.
