### Installing PFsense On A Virtual Machine

## Installing PFSense on a virtual machine as well as implementing firewall routing rules.


## First I created a new VM running Linux Debian x64, and configured an additional Network adapter to route traffic to an internal network.

## I then downloaded and installed PFsense.


I downloaded PFSense as an ISO and mounted it to the drive of the VM. 
(The download is a .gz file so because I was using Windows I needed to download Winzip to decompress the file)

Once I started the machine the install went pretty quickly and I was able to install PFsense by follwing the installation prompts

## Logging into the WebGUI 

I used a Linux client that I connected to the internal network (LAN1) to access the WebGUI and finish the set up process. Most importantly here is where you can change the default password.

## Testing the Firewall

I performed a simple test of the firewall by blocking ICMP traffic, and performing a ping.

**Before blocking**

**New rule blocking ICMP**

![Rule.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Rule.png)


**After blocking**
![ping test 2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ping test 2.png)

We can see that the rule successfully dropped the ICMP traffic
